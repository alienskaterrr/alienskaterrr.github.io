<h1>ELLA SMITH ASSIGNMENT ONE</h1>
<h2>INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCE RESEARCH PROJECT, DOWNSTREAM</h2>

<h1>QUESTION ONE</h1>
<h2>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h2>
The first thing I paid attention to when interacting with the experience was the functionality
of the symbols on the keypad to the left of the website's UI. Typically the design choice is 
reflective of what media it is advertising; in this case a video game, so it looks like a video
game would, but it is lacking in functionality. This site was the opposite, and whilst it did say
press to begin, indicating some degree of necessary interaction, I wasn't expecting the ability
to not only toggle difficulty but prompt unique dialogue depending on your success regarding the 
minigame. I spent some time here.

<h1>QUESTION TWO</h1>
<h2>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of your discrete actions.</h2>
My discrete actions within the experience were as follows:
<ul>Turning on the sound
    Clicking the icons
    Turning the slider up and down 
    Pressing the power button 
    Clicking the game report 
    Clicking play 
    Entering my email for sign up 
    Clicking the information button 
</ul>

<h1>QUESTION THREE</h1>
<h2>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h2>
The part of the experience I spent the most time engaging with was the icon 
pattern test. I enjoyed the different difficulty settings and icon variety, as 
the patterns could be quite random and hasty, making it more different and therefore
interesting. I found myself completing it multiple times, toggling the difficulty 
each time to test my speed and memory. I felt it was a fun way to placate users waiting 
to play the game, as well as display the developer's skill, being capable of making 
even their advertising website engaging and enjoyable.

<h1>QUESTION FOUR</h1>
<h2>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h2>
The most common action in my two minute interaction with the experience was attempting to type in 
the secret code. To the bottom left of the site there is a panel that if clicked on enough times 
will fall off the screen, revealing a text box requesting a special code. This code no doubt 
would trigger some form of response from the website. However with the little time provide I did 
not prove successful.

<h1>QUESTION FIVE</h1>
<h2>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the experience?</h2>
My impression of the intended primary goal of the experience is that it aims to engage
users by presenting it as not only an ad but a game. It exceeds the norm regarding what
you would expect from an advertisment for a small project such as Downstream, displaying
the talent of the developers to prove that even marketing uses creative strategy.
It makes an impression on both consumers and employers alike, making them want to 
subscribe to the project in hopes of it's success, making them more likley to purchase
the full product when available.

<h1>QUESTION SIX</h1>
<h2>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h2>
The interactive experience communicates this primary goal by presenting the 
title of the game, asking for the user's email, greeting the user and introducing
itself as "Morton", a character with relevance in the game, it also prompts the user
to sign up to the game and simply states "play the game". 
All of these explicitly inform the user of what they want them to do. 
But they also pique interest by utilising unique mechancis through minigames,
secret functions, audio, activity status, statistics and a consistent movement
on screen. 

<h1>QUESTION SEVEN</h1>
<h2>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? For how long and how many times.</h2>
My impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time is that it should take the average user anywhere between
10 to 20 minutes, as well as 5 separate attempts or reloads rather, to fully appreciate the site's design and utilise all it has
to offer regarding both verbal and visual information, plus interactive segments. In regards to five attemps, within the Downstream site,
there is a minigame involving a keypad and difficult bar where users can toggle between 56 to 160 difficulty, the power of the 
number indicating difficulty. Depending on this setting the speed and patterns will become faster and harder or easier and slower,
the game itself is however merely a simple concept of repeating what you see before you in the time limit. On top of this, there is 
audio to be activated. This will reveal that certain panels and segments of the site make sound, and some, like the panel to the 
bottom left, can even fall off screen and reveal secret text bars. There are also things to be clicked for visual changes, like the power 
button and ticket section that turn off the lights and have the game's relevant statistics print and fall. 
To the top right users can also access both a Discord and Information Segment of the website dedicated solely to Downstream's 
release and development information, being less cryptic than the base of the site.
It tells us as users what it wants us to do, which is sign up to purchase the game and follows it's development, both 
implicitly and explicitly.

<h1>QUESTION EIGHT</h1>
<h2>How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h2>
The interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time by 
presenting the user with different message and text on screen, constantly changing, both with or
without the user needing to interact. For example, there is an emoticon that will change it's face, 
the box next to it will ask questions and provide insights, the text to the right asks
boldly for our email, and the tab at the bottom spits out paper with relevant statistics, and 
neighbours the game's activity status to let us know if it is ready to play.
These are all either an implicit or explicit message to get you to sign up and play.

<h1>QUESTION NINE</h1>
<h2>What other media forms, digital or otherwise, does the experience reference?</h2>
Other media forms referenced on the Downstream website include: 
<ul>Social media. Referenced in the form of the linked Discord icon.
    3D modelling. Upon clicking the info button 3D modelling images taken from game
    development are present.
    2D pixel art. Present in the form of the pixel face.
</ul>

<h1>QUESTION TEN</h1>
<h2>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h2>
The references present on the Downstream experience communicate to me that I should act as a consumer when engaging. 
It provides me with a perfectly curated balance of entertainment and information, with small functions and perhaps 
teasers as to what main gameplay will be like, prompting me to engage with interest and thought towards each function; 
wondering "Would I play this?" or "Do I like it?". This is pushed further with the sign up, play and game activity status 
all available on the website's front. 

<h1>QUESTION ELEVEN</h1>
<h2>How does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h2>
These references communicate to me that I should feel interested and like I'm having fun, perhaps slightly challenged too. 
By using a variety of media the developers clearly have intentions to display their talent, and attract consumers and 
employers alike, attempting to build a solid reputation. The consistent audio as well as visual movement garners my attention 
and the minigames are enjoyable even if brief. 

<h1>QUESTION TWELVE</h1>
<h2>What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h2>
The most frustrating part of the interaction to me is the lack of explicit correlation between the site and the game itself. 
I have not purchased/played the game however based on the descriptions both visual and verbal provided, and with knowledge of 
the base site, it seems there is a disconnect between the two. Based on what I experienced on the first screen I would assume 
a somewhat robotic, two or lesser toned game with a futuristic, puzzle based gameplay style, with no correlations to animals 
or nature. However upon exploring the information on the site about Downstream, it appears quite different. Whilst it is by no
means an advertisment that is pretending to be something related to the final product, it is still somewhat bait or trap like
when comparing the two experiences , and that makes it frustrating. 

<h1>QUESTION THIRTEEN</h1>
<h2>What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h2>
The most satisfying part of the interaction is winning the minigame. Upon completing it with accuracy the icons will flash, 
a thumbs up will appear and the entire website will briefly change/invert certain colours flashing quickly. It is reminiscent 
of certain old games having visually appealing light/colour patterns when triumphing, such as collecting a major item in class
The Legend of Zelda titles. It is satisfying because it feels like reliving old memories, nostalgia is quite powerful.
